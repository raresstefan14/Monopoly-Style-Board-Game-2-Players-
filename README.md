## ðŸŽ² What this project is  
This project recreates a simplified board game in the spirit of Monopoly:  
- Two players move around a board, buy properties, pay rent, and try to out-smart each other.  
- Implemented in C (or whatever language you used) with clear game structure, turn logic and saving of player state.  
- Ideal for learning game design, control flow, file I/O, and struct usage.

## ðŸ§® Features  
- Board setup, property ownership, rent costs  
- Dice-rolling and movement logic  
- Buying and selling properties  
- End game condition when one player goes bankrupt  
- Simple, text-based UI in the console
